To Do:

[+] Add stubs for all additional grammar visitor functions

[+] Create new class to replace integer for memory storage.
Needs to accomodate integers and vectors of integers

[+] Change return value of interpreter functions to this new class

[+] Fix existing grammar visitor functions

[+] Fill in stubs for new grammar functions

[+] Add vector[i] stuff

[+] Add vector math functions (vector + vector, vector * vector, etc)

[+] Add vector compares (>/<. ==/!==)

[+] Add type promotion math functions (vector + int, vector * int, etc)

[+] Add scoping code

[+] Add type checking / type promotion / type safety code

[+] Get basic LLVM print integer working

[ ] Get LLVM integer assign working


Question:

if vector f is 2 long, and is 8 long,
should f*g be 2? or 8.

g * f should be 8 im pretty sure, but im not sure about f*g


on compares, what happens if the left hand side vector is smaller than the right hand side? I'm going to assume the output should be the size of the left hand vector


Check this:
in the pdf, it says:
vector j = 0..3;
print(j*2); -> [0 2 6 8]

should be [0 2 4 6] right?
