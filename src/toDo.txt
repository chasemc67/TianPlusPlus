To Do:

[+] Add stubs for all additional grammar visitor functions

[+] Create new class to replace integer for memory storage.
Needs to accomodate integers and vectors of integers

[+] Change return value of interpreter functions to this new class

[+] Fix existing grammar visitor functions

[+] Fill in stubs for new grammar functions

[+] Add vector[i] stuff

[+] Add vector math functions (vector + vector, vector * vector, etc)

[ ] Add vector compares (>/<. ==/!==)

[ ] Add type promotion math functions (vector + int, vector * int, etc)

[ ] Add scoping code

[ ] Add type checking / type promotion / type safety code

[+] Get basic LLVM print integer working

[ ] Get LLVM integer assign working


Question:

if vector f is 2 long, and is 8 long,
should f*g be 2? or 8.

g * f should be 8 im pretty sure, but im not sure about f*g


on compares, what happens if the left hand side vector is smaller than the right hand side? I'm going to assume the output should be the size of the left hand vector
